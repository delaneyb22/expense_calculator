# expense_calculator
# Overview



I created a program that is a basic expenses calculator. The user first enters the budget they'd like to have for the month, then they put in how much they spend into different categories. This could be rent, gas, food etc. The program adds the categories together and then says if the user is over or under budget. 

This program can provide a way for someone to know if they are within a budget for themselves.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

Things I would want to improve in this program:

- Save spending records in a list/file 
- Pull previous month's spending to compare to this months from that list/file
- Ask the user if they would like help or advice on how to save money
